            <h3>Skis, Poles, and Bindings</h3>
            <p>If you do not own or lease skis, you will need to rent them from the resort. Rental employees are knowledgeable 
                and will guide you through your rental decisions, making sure your skis and poles are suitable for beginners. 
                They will also help set up the ski bindings to the proper setting based upon your size and ability.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Ski Boots</h3>
            <p>You can rent ski boots at the resort, but this is not recommended. Boots are designed to conform to your feet, 
                so often times rental boots are very uncomfortable. If at all possible, we suggest purchasing your own boots, 
                even if it is your first time. You will be far more comfortable and enjoy the experience much more. Your boots 
                should be snug, but not overly tight.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Ski Helmet</h3>
            <p>For first timers, safety is paramount and you should never mess around with head injuries. There are an 
                assortment of helmets available to purchase (or rent) so you should be able to locate one that fits and works properly.</p>
        </div>
        
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Ski Jacket and Ski Pants</h3>
            <p>Wearing clothing that is warm, insulated, and wind / water resistant is also key. While on the mountain, the weather 
                can fluctuate and become cold and wet in an instant. Weather resistant clothing will keep your body comfortable and 
                dry regardless of the conditions. Being cold is the quickest way to ruin your day, so ski jackets and pants are essential.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Base and Mid Layers</h3>
            <p>Base layers are what you wear under your jacket and pants and are often are just as important, especially in colder climates. 
                When applying your base layers avoid cotton products, as they are neither waterproof nor breathable. 
                Synthetic material or wool works best.
                If it is very cold, then adding a mid layer over the base is suggested. A fleece, sweater, and other similar clothing 
                will keep you warm on the mountain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Gloves / Mittens</h3>
            <p>Insulated gloves or mittens are also very important ski items. Since your hands will be in contact with the snow throughout 
                the day, waterproof gloves or mittens are a necessity. Your gloves or mittens should also offer enough dexterity so you 
                can easily hold on to the ski poles.</p>
        </div>
        
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Ski Socks</h3>
            <p>Along with your hands, keeping your feet dry is also essential to enjoying your day. You should bring a minimum of 
                two pair of ski socks, as you never know if you will need the second pair. Your socks also should be made out of 
                wool or synthetic materials in order to keep your feet dry.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Goggles</h3>
            <p>Goggles help increase your vision while battling glare and precipitation. If you are renting a helmet at the 
                resort, it may also help to rent your goggles as well. Goggles often fit differently depending on the helmet, 
                so this will ensure they fit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Backpack</h3>
            <p>To ensure you are prepared for anything, bringing a backpack filled with an assortment of items is wise. 
                For example, you can pack sunscreen, lip protection, scarves, hats, medical kits, and other small items.</p>
        </div>
        
    </div>
    <p>When you have confirmed that you have everything on this list, you are ready to hit the slopes.</p>
